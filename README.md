# spikestrap
Kinda like bloxstrap, but for sober on linux. This is in it's very early stages so it might be buggy...

Install:

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/NewbestDev/spikestrap/releases/tag/spikestrap-2)
Run `python3` and then the path to the file
And that's it! You should be running spikestrap now!
