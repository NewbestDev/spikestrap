Kinda like bloxstrap, but for sober on linux. This is in it's very early stages so it might be buggy...

Install:

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/NewbestDev/spikestrap/releases/tag/spikestrap-2) and download spikestrap.py

Run `python3 /path/to/spikestrap.py` in your terminal emulator, and that's it! You should be running spikestrap now!
